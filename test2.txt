Due date: Feb. 7th, 2014 (by midnight)
Design and write a program that recognizes simple date expressions like: “January 15, 2014", "the 21st of December", "01/15/2014" (only the American notation), "Monday", "Monday the 23rd", “Christmas", "Labor Day". You have to identify and extract the longest expression to receive full credit. For example, if the text says ".. The mayor addressed the audience on Feb. 14th, 2012..", you should extract "Feb. 14th, 2012" and not only "Feb. 14th".

Your program should recognize all such "absolute" dates, but not "relative" ones relative to a particular day like "the day before yesterday". Whenever possible use representations that capture classes of words (e.g. holidays such as Labor Day, Memorial Day, Christmas, etc).

The program receives as input a text file (e.g., “input.txt”) and should produce a list of identified dates as output (one per line). Test your program on different text files and make sure it works. Your program will be tested on a randomly selected file (i.e., a news article or snippets from a novel) and your grade will be proportional to the performance of the program output (i.e., how many dates you identified and how many of those you identified are correct).
In order to encourage a good programming style, part of the grade will take that into consideration (as explained in class).
